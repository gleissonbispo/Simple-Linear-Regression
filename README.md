# Studies and Analysis using Simple Linear Regression

### Click on the folders above to see the projects

Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables:

- One variable, denoted x, is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
- The other variable, denoted y, is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.

Simple linear regression gets its adjective "simple," because it concerns the study of only one predictor variable.
